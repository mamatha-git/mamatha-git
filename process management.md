# 🐧 Process Management in Linux

## 📖 Introduction
A **process** is an instance of a running program. Linux provides multiple utilities to monitor, manage, and control processes effectively.  
Each process has a unique **Process ID (PID)** and belongs to a **parent process**.

## 📑 Index of Commands
### 🔍 Viewing Processes
- `ps aux` – View all running processes  
- `ps -u username` – View processes for a specific user  
- `ps -C processname` – Show a process by name  
- `pgrep processname` – Find a process by name and return its PID  
- `pidof processname` – Find the PID of a running program  

### 🛠 Managing Processes
- `kill PID` – Terminate a process by PID  
- `pkill processname` – Terminate a process by name  
- `kill -9 PID` – Force kill a process  
- `pkill -9 processname` – Kill all instances of a process  
- `kill -STOP PID` – Stop a running process  
- `kill -CONT PID` – Resume a stopped process  
- `renice -n 10 -p PID` – Lower priority of a process  
- `renice -n -5 -p PID` – Increase priority of a process (requires root)  

### ⚙ Background & Foreground Processes
- `command &` – Run a command in the background  
- `jobs` – List background jobs  
- `fg %jobnumber` – Bring a job to the foreground  
- `Ctrl + Z` – Suspend a running process  
- `bg %jobnumber` – Resume a suspended process in the background  

### 📊 Monitoring System Processes
- `top` – Interactive process viewer  
- `htop` – User-friendly process viewer (requires installation)  
- `nice -n 10 command` – Run a command with a specific priority  
- `renice -n -5 -p PID` – Change priority of an existing process  

### 🔄 Daemon Process Management
- `systemctl list-units --type=service` – List all system daemons  
- `systemctl start service-name` – Start a daemon/service  
- `systemctl stop service-name` – Stop a daemon/service  
- `systemctl enable service-name` – Enable a service at startup

## 📜 Viewing Process Details
### Using **ps**
- Show processes for a specific user:  
  ```bash
  ps -u username
````

* Show a process by name:

  ```bash
  ps -C processname
  ```

### Using **pgrep**

* Find a process by name and return its PID:

  ```bash
  pgrep processname
  ```

### Using **pidof**

* Find the PID of a running program:

  ```bash
  pidof processname
  ```

## 🛑 Managing Processes

### Killing Processes

* Terminate by PID:

  ```bash
  kill PID
  ```
* Terminate by process name:

  ```bash
  pkill processname
  ```
* Force kill a process:

  ```bash
  kill -9 PID
  ```
* Kill all instances of a process:

  ```bash
  pkill -9 processname
  ```

### Stopping & Resuming Processes

* Stop a running process:

  ```bash
  kill -STOP PID
  ```
* Resume a stopped process:

  ```bash
  kill -CONT PID
  ```

### Changing Process Priority

* View process priorities:

  ```bash
  top  # Look at the NI column
  ```
* Change priority of a running process:

  ```bash
  renice -n 10 -p PID  # Lower priority (positive values)
  renice -n -5 -p PID  # Higher priority (negative values, root required)
  ```

---

## ⚙ Running Processes in the Background

* Run a command in the background:

  ```bash
  command &
  ```
* List background jobs:

  ```bash
  jobs
  ```
* Bring a job to the foreground:

  ```bash
  fg %jobnumber
  ```
* Send a running process to the background:

  ```bash
  Ctrl + Z  # Suspend process
  bg %jobnumber  # Resume in background
  ```

---

## 📈 Monitoring System Processes

### Using **top**

Interactive process viewer:

* Press `k` and enter a PID to kill a process.
* Press `r` to renice a process.
* Press `q` to quit.

### Using **htop**

A user-friendly alternative to top:

```bash
htop
```

* Allows mouse-based interaction for process management.

### Using **nice** & **renice**

* Run a command with a specific priority:

  ```bash
  nice -n 10 command
  ```
* Change the priority of an existing process:

  ```bash
  renice -n -5 -p PID
  ```

---

## 🧰 Daemon Processes

* List all system daemons:

  ```bash
  systemctl list-units --type=service
  ```
* Start a daemon:

  ```bash
  systemctl start service-name
  ```
* Stop a daemon:

  ```bash
  systemctl stop service-name
  ```
* Enable a service at startup:

  ```bash
  systemctl enable service-name
  ```

## ✅ Conclusion

Process management is **crucial** for system performance and stability.
By using tools like **ps**, **top**, **htop**, **kill**, and **nice**, you can **efficiently control and monitor Linux processes**.
